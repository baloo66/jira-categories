#summary Categories to easy life with JIRA
#labels GroovyJIRA

= Introduction = 

Working a while programming scripts in Groovy for JIRA tasks, we discovered, that Categories seem to be a good way, to hide boiler-plating code from the real functional scripts.

Searching here and there, googling around - but we found no such Categories freely available.

So we decided, to write them - and to share them ...

We hope, that they are useful for other people. And - maybe - there are others contributing, removing bugs, provide new functionality and much more.

Feel free to use, comment, contribute, modify and improve
